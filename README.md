Modern template for NodeJS Express backends and microservices

Just define your sequelize models and you get a fully documented CRUD API with SwaggerUI

That's it, focus on actual functionality, automate the boilerplate stuff

## Developer Experience

- Async Errors
- Sequelize
- Auto CRUD API Routes for Models
- SwaggerUI with Auto Markup for Models
- JWT Security
- Auth0 Authentication
